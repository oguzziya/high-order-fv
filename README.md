# High-order Finite Volume Methods

Repository for the seminar course *Fundamentals of Wave Simulation - Solving Hyperbolic Systems of PDEs* in TUM for 
winter semester 2020.

Code contains a solver for 1D advection equation and Burger's equation (not fully implemented yet) with Godunov's method. 
Various flux limiters are available to test out their effects. For more information on the theoretical background, 
refer to the report.
